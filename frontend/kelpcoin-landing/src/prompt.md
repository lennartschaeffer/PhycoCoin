A **peer‑to‑peer Nutrient Trading Credit (NTC) platform**—“PhycoCoins”—that:

1. **Validates** harvests via AI‑driven MRV on environmental sensor data (no cameras required).
2. **Calculates** nutrient removal from validated wet biomass (dry = W/10; N = 2% dry; P = 0.2% dry; C = 3% wet).
3. **Prices** each PhycoCoin by **market-weighted values** (e.g. $20/kg N, $500/kg P, $5/kg C).
4. **Enables** bilateral trades and dynamic auctions directly between **regulated polluters** (e.g. WWTPs, pulp mills) and farmers—bypassing exchange oversupply.
5. **Logs** all data, model versions, and trades on‑chain for full auditability.
